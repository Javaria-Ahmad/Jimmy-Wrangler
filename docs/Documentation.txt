Data Sets:

Two data sets were obtained from Data.gov called MedicarePayments.csv and MedicareRegisteredHospital.csv. 
The first data set contains information about hospitals and their Medicare transactions. 
The assumption is that these hospitals do not have to be Medicare registered even if they made payments.

The second data set has all the records which are registered Medicare hospitals. Overall hospital rating is included in this data set as well.

Goal:

The goal was to find the states with high number of hospitals with good healthcare standards (Medicare registered, high hospital rating, high Medicare payments).

Approach:

The two data sets were loaded into Panda data frames. Then these were combined on Provider ID field.
New features were created to mark the hospitals that were registered and that had high average Medicare payments.
Such hospitals were counted to identify the states containing the number of such hospitals. That helped in recognizing states with high healthcare.

Results:

From the counts and bar chart, it was concluded that California has the highest number of Medicare registered hospitals that has 
high overall ratings and high average Medicare payments. This state was concluded to be the highest in healthcare standard.
The lowest state was Wyoming.
